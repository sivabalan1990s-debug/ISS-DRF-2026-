# Trust-Aware Research Framework

This document outlines a conceptual framework for conducting
independent, globally verifiable research with an emphasis on
trust, transparency, and ethical disclosure.

The framework addresses:
- Identity verification without oversharing
- Independent researcher credibility
- Secure and ethical research dissemination

## Motivation
Independent researchers often lack institutional identity signals.
This framework explores mechanisms for establishing trust without
oversharing sensitive personal data.

## Core Principles
- Minimal disclosure
- Verifiability over visibility
- Ethical transparency
- Independence with accountability

## Intended Outcomes
- Reduced identity friction in academic collaboration
- Safer verification practices
- Globally acceptable independent research workflows

## Scope and Limitations
This framework does not aim to replace institutional affiliations,
government-issued identity documents, or formal credentialing systems.
Instead, it complements existing structures by providing a minimal,
ethical, and verifiable layer of trust for independent researchers
operating across borders and institutions.

# Trust-Aware Verification Workflow

This diagram describes the conceptual workflow for trust-aware
verification in independent research contexts.

## Actors
- Independent Researcher
- Host Institution / Evaluator
- Verification Interface (SSS-PVS)
- Public Research Artifacts (ISS-DRF)

## Workflow Steps
1. Researcher presents a minimal verification link.
2. Evaluator accesses a private verification interface.
3. Public research artifacts establish intellectual credibility.
4. Official documents are requested only if legally required.
5. Trust is established without excessive disclosure.

## Key Properties
- Minimal disclosure
- Context-dependent verification
- Ethical boundary enforcement
- No replacement of legal identity systems

# Trust-Aware Verification Workflow

This conceptual workflow describes how trust can be established
for independent researchers without excessive disclosure of
personal or institutional identity information.

## Actors
- Independent Researcher
- Host Institution / Evaluator
- Personal Verification Interface (SSS-PVS)
- Public Research Artifacts (ISS-DRF Repository)

## Workflow Steps
1. The independent researcher shares a minimal verification link.
2. The evaluator accesses a private verification interface.
3. Public research artifacts establish intellectual credibility.
4. Context-specific verification is requested only if legally required.
5. Trust is established without persistent or unnecessary data exposure.

## Design Principles
- Minimal disclosure
- Separation of identity and credentials
- Context-aware verification
- Ethical boundary enforcement

## Scope
This workflow complements existing institutional and legal systems.
It does not replace passports, visas, affiliations, or credentials.
