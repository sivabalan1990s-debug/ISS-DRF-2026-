### Conclusion

This paper offers an approach to facilitating independent and ethical research through a trust-based research framework. The framework is designed to fill the void in current trust-based models by utilizing minimal disclosure, making public research artifacts and allowing contextually-based verification without introducing any new identity-based models.

This research framework provides a basis for creating a foundation for future research at the intersection of ethical principles, research practice, and global cooperation in education through empirical examination and review.
