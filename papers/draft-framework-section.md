## Trust-Aware Research Framework

The proposed trust-aware research framework provides a conceptual
structure for establishing researcher credibility without relying on
persistent institutional identity signals.

The framework is grounded in three core ideas:
1. Separation of intellectual credibility from formal identity disclosure.
2. Reliance on publicly verifiable research artifacts.
3. Context-aware escalation to official documentation only when required.

Rather than introducing new identity infrastructures, the framework
operates as a complementary layer that aligns with existing academic,
legal, and institutional practices.


The framework is intentionally lightweight and non-prescriptive.
It does not mandate specific technologies, platforms, or identity
mechanisms. Instead, it provides a principled structure that can be
adapted across disciplines, jurisdictions, and institutional contexts
without imposing additional infrastructural burdens.
