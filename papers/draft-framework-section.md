## Trust-Aware Research Framework

The proposed trust-aware research framework provides a conceptual
structure for establishing researcher credibility without relying on
persistent institutional identity signals.

The framework is grounded in three core ideas:
1. Separation of intellectual credibility from formal identity disclosure.
2. Reliance on publicly verifiable research artifacts.
3. Context-aware escalation to official documentation only when required.

Rather than introducing new identity infrastructures, the framework
operates as a complementary layer that aligns with existing academic,
legal, and institutional practices.
