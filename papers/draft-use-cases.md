## Use Cases and Scenarios

This section outlines illustrative scenarios in which the proposed
trust-aware research framework can support ethical and effective
academic interaction involving independent researchers.

### Scenario 1: Conference Participation
An independent researcher submits work to an international conference
and provides a minimal verification reference. Evaluators assess the
researcher’s credibility through publicly available research artifacts,
requesting formal documentation only if required by conference policy.

### Scenario 2: Visiting Research Collaboration
A host institution considers a short-term research visit. Initial trust
is established through transparent scholarly activity and prior work,
with institutional onboarding processes applied only at later stages.

### Scenario 3: Grant or Fellowship Evaluation
Funding bodies evaluate research proposals based on documented research
outputs and ethical disclosures, reducing reliance on institutional
affiliation as a proxy for credibility.
