## Introduction

Independent researchers play a larger role in advancing scientific and technological knowledge than they ever have before. In addition to being an important part of the research community, independent researchers' contributions to knowledge creation are not necessarily grounded in formal institutional affiliations or persistent identification.

This study presents a conceptual trust-supporting research framework to assist ethical and ethical development of trustworthy independent researchers who are able to develop trust according to common ethical, transparent and globally available methods of independent researchers' research. The research framework separates the credibility of the researcher from any formal identification of the researcher, enabling the evaluator to evaluate the legitimacy of a research product based on a public artifact while maintaining the legal and ethical limits of the work of the researcher.

The research framework is conceptual in nature, and it does not provide rules or recommendations for how to create a research framework. The emphasis of the framework is on clarity, simplicity, and consistency with the existing academic and legal systems.
