## Discussion

This trust-aware research framework indicates a fundamental transition away from using institution-based trust models toward using an artifact-based method of credibility assessment. The trust-aware framework uses publicly-verifiable products (projects) of research to enable evaluators to assess scholarly content, rather than using the institution as an external proxy for the evaluation of content. 

This new method of assessing research works particularly well in the global and interdisciplinary research settings. As international and interdisciplinary collaborations grow, there is increasing concern that previous measures of institutional signals to consider the quality and ethical practices of research may not apply equally. At the same time, the framework is consistent with the current legal and administrative processes for providing escalation that is context-based.

The key strength of the framework is its discipline. Rather than proposing new identity-based infrastructures as part of the evaluation process for research content, the framework operates to define the boundaries, responsibilities, and decision-making authorities that are in place within the current infrastructures already being used. The result is a methodology that can be used for assessing content across multiple domains while providing the least amount of ethical and operational risk.
