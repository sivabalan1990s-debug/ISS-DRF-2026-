## Problem Statement

Independent researchers increasingly contribute to scientific and
technological advancement across disciplines. However, in the absence
of formal institutional affiliations, they often face challenges in
establishing trust, credibility, and legitimacy during academic
collaboration, evaluation, and mobility processes.

Existing verification mechanisms rely heavily on institutional identity,
persistent credential disclosure, or platform-based profiling. These
approaches can inadvertently encourage oversharing of sensitive personal
information, introduce ethical risks, and disadvantage independent
researchers who operate outside traditional organizational structures.

There is a need for a research-oriented framework that enables trust
formation without excessive disclosure, balances transparency with
privacy, and remains compatible with existing legal and institutional
requirements. Addressing this gap is essential for supporting ethical,
inclusive, and globally verifiable independent research practices.
