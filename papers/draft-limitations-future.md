## Limitations and Future Work

This project is conceptual and doesn’t include any kind of empirical studies or deployment studies to assess whether it would actually work in real-world institutions.

Future projects could include empirical validation via case studies and stakeholder interviews, as well as pilot programs in specific jurisdictions. Additional research could examine the framework's relation to discipline-specific norms and changing regulatory requirements.

These limitations are purposeful because the framework is intended to be used as a foundational document and not a completed system.
