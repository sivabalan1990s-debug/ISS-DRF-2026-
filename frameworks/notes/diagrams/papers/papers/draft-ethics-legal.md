## Ethical and Legal Considerations

Any framework for researcher verification must operate within clearly
defined ethical and legal boundaries. This work does not propose the
replacement of government-issued identification, institutional
credentialing, or formal regulatory processes.

Instead, the framework emphasizes minimal disclosure, context-aware
verification, and respect for jurisdiction-specific legal requirements.
Official documents are considered only when legally mandated, while
routine academic trust is established through public research artifacts
and transparent scholarly activity.

By explicitly separating intellectual credibility from formal identity
disclosure, the framework seeks to reduce unnecessary exposure of
personal data and mitigate risks associated with surveillance,
misuse, or identity profiling.
