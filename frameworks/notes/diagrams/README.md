# Diagrams

System architecture diagrams, workflow illustrations, and conceptual models
related to ISS-DRF research.

Figure 1 illustrates a trust-aware verification workflow for independent
researchers. The workflow separates intellectual credibility from formal
identity disclosure, allowing evaluators to assess research legitimacy
through public artifacts while reserving official document requests
for legally required contexts only.
